The second thing that i think we need to think about is the sort of acosta civic life and how do we serve really start to both sit issues that are important to us in civic life we just published a study that took well over a year we looked at 13 jurisdictions in the us currently covered by consent decrees are all the types of judicial orders. Structural racism that is informing the ai tools of the future. The new zealand shooting with that are just being directed and recommended. The same walter cronkite carl sagan side of youtube and then you have the crazy town side of youtube. And i really think that the best quote describes the entire situation that is the problem staying right now. We have the power of god without the wisdom love and compassion of god. Efficient but i tried to change the inside a google for 2 years. And that's when something started to change them course cambridge analytica these events are really what started the drive with the industry. But if you're the guy you know inside of youtube who says hey our recommendation system is systematically hearing people towards the crazy stuff. And i'm just curious i want to dig into that a little bit of that will kind of make a conversation. And then does other views about dinner we can still outweigh through this i'm just curious susan and eric in particular you've been thinking a lot about these work jobs question. Contraction of the labor market he argues is larger quantitative effect than. Question to start asking you need to think about these in general ecolibrium you can't just look at one side of supply and demand. Productively employed of course this is now kind of unpaid work which is. One adult per child and maybe two and so i think i just think that when you when you look at it that way it will there be a positive marginal product for human labor in the future given our demographics of course there will be the question is really then you how do you pay for it. Time frame and i think too many people jump to this hollywood artificial general intelligence. Childcare healthcare kennedy varmint in creative work and scientific works in arts and i can go on many other things that. But if we did more on those side i think that you said early there's no shortage of work for humans to do. And the technology right now is is too often being used simply to automate certain kinds of tasks. Leaving people without working those areas and not often enough used. Using somebody's image i'm classifying humans or using the woods or anything. And these points become data inside of predictive policing system that we aren't out surveillance is actually working and we're resources of. I've really been thinking very hard about where else we can see these types of. Now parody is not finished just because the system works exactly the same on people with lighter skin in dhaka skins doesn't mean that we can use we are currently using at such a nice fairway. The other thing is this subtler and is it also reported you question about do we how do we define. Is that when we write these systems it forces us to confront what are real goals are what are real values are allowed that gets blurred when people are making a decision in the blink of an eye or in a in a private hiring thing. You're trying to maybe create a platform that works for everybody that's safe. So even putting aside whatever poor incentives you think firms have. That we need to develop over over a. of time that we can make. So you're not ready able to order it that it doesn't have a certain public transparency rule where is accountability coming that's. And then we in spokane valley with a libertarian mindset say that's just giving people what they want. And so just kept giving people what they wanted and that key word was trump. Now that's like saying well maybe you know those african-americans we piped into those that dataset five generations ago and hauled them through the system so now. Can i propagate through culture now that's a norman we forgot where it came from and. Quick up she's not a good measure of his of making them happy. Why because the technology is something that you want to optimize you want to measure quickly. In the 1890s and we were facing massive technological change the united states and northern european countries. Get involved i was talking recently was up with a technologist up developing some ai technologies and. Just as fast because it was the humans who were really that the bad actors they're deciding. Lot of issues that have been coming out of technology company that's new. That you did something wrong because you didn't act on information that you had. So i think that really this this this desire for sort of sensible guidance and regulation. With desperation that we have to build a more inclusive and warfare anymore independent. Working for nonprofit salaries with that or fellowships in brazil or something. And that's how and it's through that kind of research that then you try to get a congressman to say hey we got to have a hearing and that's how you get the hearing to happen and he don't want civilians with like no resources being the sole accountability structure for these massive. We need structural accountability systems we all agree that we. We've often talked about the big seven in the us and if you include china and that you might be talking about pretty less than a dozen companies that are really powerful enough to be using ii's scale and cool sarah set of leading universities including this one really important that i'm driving. So when we start to talk about what that looks like geopolitically it actually starts to look. We need penney high count between three to four nations where everybody else is being relegated to become my client state.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(bert_summary)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9JR4WJdBBxio","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323413186,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":704,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"4fe06c37-8f0d-4be5-c5ea-d69384747373"},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["8045"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":52}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"b0Wx4Qr4CF-D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323426290,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"04faed41-804c-4e87-9af9-115bd09ec41b"},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["52000"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":53}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["GPT2_model = TransformerSummarizer(transformer_type=\"GPT2\",transformer_model_key=\"gpt2-medium\")\n","full = ''.join(GPT2_model(text, min_length=60))\n","print(full)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":182,"referenced_widgets":["3d39281d77b9403fa05dae3dee44cecc","ce626a3c3f1f4d65827e964413234de3","733b362e08f74e5483d354a0eb5095e6","2baf5315362f4d5197c490d635b3f8ed","fed131cf904d4500bfd0bd8df6c6e4d7","7dee23d529764552bbc76c80154815d5","d91c1edfa56c443a8b55813b50a2eda9","8004751ea9e449cf8f4ed0ce7a74a1a1","c66a6b440f1b43299ad666aeed6dcd48","03d229d2b5634a74a1638645129f7576","dcd99ef5b525445c8f81ed07daa86310","e935cbfe238b457abf2418b3d9d7404e","b63cde065bcf4705b96a0fa8956080c9","25cbea91bd214ed199bd2199831bb35c","8f52a58805ad451b939cf38ec22f0298","2f91da94624241f1a4403c3bbd13c22c","eb4e9113cde74935a2d96b2a3689e4ec","105d8d84dda340f0b49ad46bcb804f6c","4a4a153166544fdda183a9f43d6480c4","e74a608893de484881fdd230d0c1dca8","608d99bea054451ab7d78327858e5eb5","18106c49b0b64d09953ddcfa0d98d6d4","dc62480ec2644d96ad222a371e5fb322","a056e53080de4446bd94859a4b501381","3a0623f0a52d4c4a83056da4a0478972","e903b675b088472eae66cdc4b814734d","c5214d6edf854429964640ba5f72346e","bf5975091380410fa42fd5ed60670be1","dde53d5e2c9140139fe67fbf11a1c643","b629cddffaf64d648e177de56c6c67ed","a824698f952d48a89497731760706634","7fc964cd8cfc49258714e0d22eb188d3","9b0393727e794b97b1d589df3a880751","eb9ada40c84b4d2b9b297519ca3d676d","d35a4e010ec24308a68b5246e0341ed0","01ad6abc236b4e39b780ec9d00a39693","0dcc069f58f343148ad44365cee854b3","b5923a2938ad4a44aa46de999b668920","bee6f9e771964d6abf4f5e936689fd26","ebf54498b0f54ef6b3bd0bc6e8184a36","37eacf6aaf0c44a2af91f3c67c4ca619","c4334eb5da4f4be494af43a204309758","6c7367ed304d4e9f8e78db1d5c70e07f","e840bd67920041198801601f49a78901"]},"id":"o_EwwzaNCM5h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323546694,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":85649,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"3b6d0f73-5226-41c0-ce68-05a695b1281f"},"execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/718 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3d39281d77b9403fa05dae3dee44cecc"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.52G [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"e935cbfe238b457abf2418b3d9d7404e"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.04M [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"dc62480ec2644d96ad222a371e5fb322"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]"],"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"eb9ada40c84b4d2b9b297519ca3d676d"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["My next session will be a panel and on the on the same topic of the impact on society. Susan athy is a professor of the economics of technology are at stanford. The chief economist at microsoft and i she works with a lot of technology companies. Will probably talk about the impact of ai on society justice equity. Because of concerns about so who's responsible for making sure all this kind of. 4 long x you mentioned since i've been working on that book with with coffee with any mcafee by the way i've been. And a lot of people were left behind and i was a little bit of a puzzle when i first looked at it cuz it is clear the technology's on sparring but they're also these challenges. Human institutions business processes change much more slowly. Algorithmic bias fake news privacy many of the other challenges. Side effects of this technology and need to be handled square on ultimately if we don't. Address them explicitly then i think other people are going to. Well i agree with eric that we generally were going to be able to make sort of more outputs with less inputs and that can potentially be good. Positive perspective i'm ai has this great feature to general-purpose technology. I know we're going to come back to these work impactful that's clear that big topic of most people's minds but is it true resident economist on r panel seasoning. But if you look back those technologies didn't instantly boost. Is interdisciplinary in or just putting within a sperm and interdisciplinary within science. So i mean i've essentially been researching the social implication. You have to put pal at the center of the analysis of how these tools are actually going to affect social institution. The first one is really what is the true cost of an ai system. What is required from a resource defective gpus at the natural mineral resources right through to the end. I'm already told me something quite profound about how we start thinking about the third of the way that they systems really work and how some of these costs are actually hitting environmental costs on his labor costs a hidden under very complex logistical and infrastructural systems. What we found is that in many cases that dirty data is being imported directly. But that's really got to make us think differently about the types of structural issues and i history and then this case particularly. I'm looking at the types of legal strategies that are being used to make sure that these systems are actually accountable and this hasn't happened before. He is so i guess i would just say this but i think it's worth thinking about on days like today. Marc andreessen has this phrase that software is eating the world. And then it starts digital frankenstein of youtube for kids starts basically directing children to baywatch. And i really think that the best quote describes the entire situation that is the problem staying right now. Become an upgraded we have our paleolithic emotions we got the 25 year-old you know what the hoodies we'd let them sort of say what's what's going to happen but that didn't work so well. And i said we had this enormous responsibility because not just me google but the entire industries holding up. Efficient but i tried to change the inside a google for 2 years. And that's when something started to change them course cambridge analytica these events are really what started the drive with the industry. There's walkouts there is a whole bunch of things that can happen but we have to figure this out. Hey isaac patton sade comes about a probably the most written-about impact sp about work. Question to start asking you need to think about these in general ecolibrium you can't just look at one side of supply and demand. And then if you'd kind of pill this apart a little bit more micro. Which then ends up transferring people into nursing homes in other forms of terror which are incredibly expensive. Childcare healthcare kennedy varmint in creative work and scientific works in arts and i can go on many other things that. So the challenge is as machines become better better doing certain types of tasks. Because it's the same people in those two different categories of risk kill everybody. So there's actually been a more of a stagnation and a slowing down on. Redeploying people and that is is just as bad as the lack of rescheduling people. Another question to which is a really important one that is hovering over this this wish to make the ai industry more ethical. If we could actually look to the social sciences where we have a long history of institutional review. Didn't have to go through a review process know right now and if we don't have any review processes like that better establish that universities and very few and industry over there are a few that is starting to emerge. Decide okay how do we want to balance these different things we can't just. What all comes with wants to be the ultimate question by that i'm just curious what us panelist think is the future we want in a human's sentence. You're trying to maybe create a platform that works for everybody that's safe. Across multiple countries multiple cultures multiple systems. The dataset that's used to power the entire internet is called the click. That they try to do the stuff to depolarize the system to make it more fair fair in your nervous system sits at a point in the bottom of the brainstem look maybe pull from somewhere else looks. Now that's like saying well maybe you know those african-americans we piped into those that dataset five generations ago and hauled them through the system so now. But it but the problem is that measuring what does make them happy is difficult slow noisy. The one one thing i talked a lot about in my executive education about ai is it hey this technology no matter what your objective is it's going to make you be more short-term focus. Maybe you put rules at the new york times just maximize four clicks the entire front page would be full of celebrity stuff within a day but they actually do have rules like certain things can't be entered into the competition for clicks on the front page. Hello thank you for thank you for the terrific remarks my name is mitchell stephens i'm a sociologist here in the graduate school of education at stanford. In the 1890s and we were facing massive technological change the united states and northern european countries. Created the regulatory apparatus that we now it inherit at the beginning of the 21st century. At nation-state governments were unequivocally in charge of where technological progress as we called with the time was being directed. These powerful technologies where there's a fire later we get burned and invent fire extinguishers are cars women seefeldt. So i think both the public sector and the private sector are really going to have to start making a lot harder that what that's going to look like and susan actually was the first person to win to mention the wood regulation i mean we've heard people like bread. But we've done it before we can look at what happened with me clear you can look at bodies like the iaea that actually looked at things like inspections into systems as ways of generating an international consensus to reduce space we're going to need similarly big picture ideas. You suddenly discover all sorts of things so you might discover that. Putting people into clusters that there's a cluster and then you look at it and it looks like these people are gambling. That you did something wrong because you didn't act on information that you had. We need structural accountability systems we all agree that we. Concentrated field then it's really a small group of people who really have their hands on the levers of power in this whole discussion. Well that's at think if nothing else is panels reinforce one thing which is why we need.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(full)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Mbd9BWbLCr3X","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323564533,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"db71ab7f-bb7a-40b5-b421-2354faa18cfb"},"execution_count":56,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["7864"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":56}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from gensim.summarization.summarizer import summarize\n","from gensim.summarization import keywords\n","\n","def summarize_text(text):\n","    try:\n","        summarized_text = summarize(text,word_count = 150)\n","        if summarized_text!=\"\":\n","            if summarized_text!=text:\n","                return summarized_text\n","            else:\n","                return \"\"\n","        else:\n","            return \"\"\n","    except Exception as e:\n","        print(\"Exception In summary-->\")\n","        print(str(e))\n","        return \"\"\n","\n","if __name__=='__main__':\n","#     sentence = input(\"Enter the sentence\")\n","    sentence = text\n","    print(summarize_text(sentence))# requires more than one sentence"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zuuJj9CrCsyC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323753948,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1081,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"2c0a4d85-473f-484c-fb02-1f1113c9176e"},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hobbykids i spent a lot of time thinking about these large-scale data systems system challenges as well as the impact on machine learning and ai so glad to have kate's here.\n","You need to think about other things to do and managers entrepreneurs need to invent new ways of recombining skills and technology.\n","I think there is the possibility to really get all the people in the room to start asking the right questions but that's an ongoing research process.\n","I know we're going to come back to these work impactful that's clear that big topic of most people's minds but is it true resident economist on r panel seasoning.\n","But i wanted to say this because we're holding on looking at this landscaping but he's different lovers who got the medieval institutions who got the inside people trying to change things from the inside the best they can against the incentives.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(summarize_text(sentence))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"w7aDt_F9C3bK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1670323794081,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":679,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Chawda","userId":"11827703042291288123"}},"outputId":"741ed65f-c368-41d6-d237-f8392ea01cea"},"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["864"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":63}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"7wtN3TtNDh5r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
